Game of Life on Meteor
======================

This is my first application using [Meteor platform](http://meteor.com).

It's a simple implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), a divertimento to try Meteor.

**Its performance is very slow**. I would like to improve it using some kind of aliveNeighbours cache or Meteor publishers and subscriptions.

You can try it at [http://game-of-life.meteor.com/](http://game-of-life.meteor.com/).
