Game of Life on Meteor
======================

This is my first application using [Meteor platform](http://meteor.com).

It's a simple implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), 
a *divertimento* to try Meteor. You can try it at [http://game-of-life.meteor.com/](http://game-of-life.meteor.com/).

*Its performance is a bit slow* considering it has only 120 cells, I would like to improve it using some kind of aliveNeighbours counter cache. 
Got a better idea? Please [tell me](http://twitter.com/mllocs).
